# Planar 3D Transfer Learning
## Utilizing 2D pre-trained weights in 3D segmentation with application on multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation

Hello everyone, this is a repository containing code to Paper "Planar 3D Transfer Learning for End to End Unimodal MRI Unbalanced Data Segmentation" soon to be published (accepted) to ICPR 2020.

Most useful parts of this repository are python keras scripts with source code for generating planar 3D weights for 2D to 3D transfer learning.
